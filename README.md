# Welcome to My Basecamp 1
***

## Task
What is basecamp?
It's a web-based project management tool launched in 2004. Its primary features are to-do lists, milestone management, forum-like messaging, file sharing, and time tracking - basecamp

We will have a to create a website which mimique features from the original tools. It means having a database, a backend and a frontend.

We want our users to create their accounts, to connect and create projects!

As developer you need to think about the User Experience and it needs to be great.

## Description
To realise this project, the Ruby on Rails (RoR) Framwork was used. It'a a frame work that uses the mcv architecture so perfect for this project
Lets break all the project down

**Views** : views represent the front-end, what the user will see.
        For this part we used HTML, CSS and bootstrap

**Controller** : Ok somehow the server, it manages the relation between the "views" and the "models"
            You will find a doc server, this doc has been manage using sinatra gem(We were young when starting so we didn't use a framework)
            some other gems used here is sinatra/flash which is used to display flash messages on screen

**Model** : This usually represented the database and models. That is all what deals with databases and classes
        -Our database is made up of 3 tables, users, projects, and project_user
        users is the table containing all users and their infos
        projects is the table containing all projects and their infos
        project_user is the table which will be the relation between each users and their projects
        For the class we got 3 to User, Project, ProjectUser for users,projects and project_user respectively
